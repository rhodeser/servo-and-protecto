Servo and Protecto
==================

In this project we will create a robot car to autonomously navigate in a given area.  It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and it will navigate accordingly.  While this is our primary goal, additional goals include using an object detection camera and controlling an apparatus when the object has been detected.

It also will use an external object detection camera that can pick up change in colors.  It will target a certain object, navigate to that object, and perform a specific action pertaining to the object.
