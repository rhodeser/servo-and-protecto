Algorithm for bot movement

setup car
    start sensors
    initialize inputs, outputs
    start moving car  ?


functions
    forward
        turn motors on in specific way
    backward
        turn motors on in specific way

    stop
        turn motors off
    left...
    right...

    search...

    // for loop, get all measurements?

Measurement Logic
    start at center
    get distance of objects from sensors 
        if distance is less than margin
            stop moving
                ...?
    turn 90ish left
    get distance of objects from sensors 
    turn 180ish right
    get distance of objects from sensors 

decide where to move next
    find direction where distance furthest away
    //use enum?

main loop

    start
    increment cycles counter
    if counter > some amount
        check surroundings
        if (some distance checks)
            move this way
        reset cycles counter

    get distance
    get movement choice


//includes, #defines, void setup(), ...

#include <Servo.h>

#define
/* brightness, speed, motors, delays, pins
 
setup()
//initialize PWM, servo control, sonar, cmucam
setmotorspeed()
//depending on terrain (carpet, floor), set speed
seterrormargin()
//depending on brightness conditions

turnleft(), turnright(), etc.
//correct combination of motor movements



void loop()
